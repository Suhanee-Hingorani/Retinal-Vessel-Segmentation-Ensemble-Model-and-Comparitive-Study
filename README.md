# Segmentation-Comparitive-Study
This repository contains the implementation of fully convolutional neural networks for segmenting retinal vasculature from fundus images.

**Four architecures/models** were made keeping U-NET architecture as the base. The models used are:

**Simple U-NET
Residual U-NET (Res-UNET)
MobileNetV2
MobilineNetV2 - Transfer Learning**

The performance metrics used for evaluation is **accuracy**.

**Objective**: Enhance the accuracy and efficiency of blood vessel segmentation.

**Motivation**: Address the labor-intensive and error-prone process of manual blood vessel segmentation, alongside the constraints of current automated techniques.

**Labels:**

White: Ground Truth Segmentation

Blue: Correct segmentation predicted by the algorithm. (True Postiive)

Green: Incorrect segmentation predicted by the algorithm. (False Positive)
